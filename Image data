Description
Objective: To investigate if artificial intelligence can identify fetus intracranial structures in pregnancy weeks 11–14;
This dataset contains 1528 2D sagittal-view ultrasound images of 1519 females collected from Shenzhen People’s Hospital. Data was used for standard/non-standard (S-NS) plane classification, a key step for NT measurement and Down Syndrome assessment. An external dataset with 156 images from the Longhua branch of Shenzhen People’s Hospital was also provided to test AI performance.
Annotations for nine key structures (thalami, midbrain, palate, 4th ventricle, cisterna magna, nuchal translucency (NT), nasal tip, nasal skin, and nasal bone) could be found in ObjectDetection.xlsx file.
